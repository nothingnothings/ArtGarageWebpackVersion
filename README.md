# ArtGarage

Frontend App built with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. Flexbox and media queries were used for the responsive design (attempting to cater to multiple device types, both desktop and mobile, with different resolutions). The webApp was bundled with Webpack and deployed with `gh-pages`, assisted by the GitHub Actions feature. It can be accessed [here](https://nothingnothings.github.io/ArtGarageWebpackVersion/).

## Technologies

Some of the Languages and Libraries employed:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (besides animations, mainly Flexbox and common styles, with media queries for adjustments)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no JavasScript frameworks; usage of `var`, normal functions and common eventListeners)
